A perfect Carolina pulled pork recipe. An authentic Carolina ’cue is the best barbecue he’s ever eaten! While ground and crushed red pepper will provide the basic heat, go the extra mile and find some Texas Pete (or Trappey's) pepper sauce to bring the taste of Carolina to your kitchen.

**Ingredients**

- 1 boneless pork shoulder butt roast (4 to 5 pounds)
- 2 tablespoons brown sugar
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- 1/2 teaspoon pepper
- 2 medium onions, quartered
- 3/4 cup cider vinegar
- 4 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 1 tablespoon crushed red pepper flakes
- 1 teaspoon garlic salt
- 1 teaspoon ground mustard
- 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 14 hamburger buns, split
- 1-3/4 pounds deli coleslaw

**Directions**

**Step 1**
Cut roast into quarters. Mix brown sugar, salt, paprika and pepper; rub over meat. Place meat and onions in a 5-qt. slow cooker.

**Step 2**
In a small bowl, whisk vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, sugar and seasonings; pour over roast. Cook, covered, on low 6-8 hours or until meat is tender.

**Step 3**
Remove roast; cool slightly. Reserve 1-1/2 cups cooking juices; discard remaining juices. Skim fat from reserved juices. Shred pork with 2 forks. Return pork and reserved juices to slow cooker; heat through. Serve on buns with coleslaw.

_Kitchen Tip_
\*Some like it hot but if you're not one of them consider reducing the crushed red pepper flakes and cayenne pepper in this sauce by half.

_Note_: Reheat the pork in a saucepan over a campfire or portable cook stove.
