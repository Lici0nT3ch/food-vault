Buttermilk fried chicken that's incredibly tender, thanks to tangy buttermilk. After the buttermilk soak, dredge the chicken pieces in seasoned flour and fry them in hot oil until crisp and golden. This buttermilk fried chicken recipe results in chicken that’s wonderfully crispy on the outside, but tender and juicy on the inside.

    **For Chicken**
      * 1 (3 1/2) pound chicken, cut into 8 pieces
      * 1 teaspoon black pepper
      * 1 teaspoon salt
      * 1 teaspoon paprika

      * ¼ teaspoon dried rosemary
      * ¼ teaspoon ground thyme
      * ¼ teaspoon dried oregano
