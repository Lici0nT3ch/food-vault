I know ceviche is actually Peruvian but it’s easily adjusted to Asian flavours as well. This is a great little dish, easy to make, amazing in flavours and texture. If you’re not comfortable using scallops any white fish, like cod, which you would usually use for ceviche will work as well, the flavours are still amazing!

**Ingredients**

- 200 - 250 g scallops (fresh from the fishmonger) or white fish (like cod)
- Juice from 1 orange
- 2 limes , zest & juice
- 1 tsp sesame oil
- 2 tablespoons light soy sauce
- 1 garlic clove, grated
- 1/2 red onion, finely chopped
- 1 small bunch of fresh coriander , leaves picked and finely sliced, stalks finely sliced
- 1/2 red chili finely sliced or 2 tsp chili oil

**Instructions**

**Step 1**
If you've bought the scallops in the shell, clean and remove the small muscle from the scallops.

**Step 2**
Slice the scallops into thin discs, ± 3 mm thick. If using white fish cut into small cubes (± 1 cm).

**Step 3**
In a medium bowl mix together the orange juice, lime juice & zest, sesame oil, garlic and soy sauce. Taste and adjust to your liking.

**Step 4**
To the bowl add the scallops making sure they're all soaking in the juices.

**Step 5**
Cover and refrigerate for a minimum of 30 minutes, up to 4 hours. They will cook naturally in the juices.

**Step 6**
When ready to serve layout the slices on a plate, drizzle with the juices, some freshly chopped chili's or chili oil and a few leaves of koriander.

**Step 7**
If you want the marinade to be more spicy you can already add the fresh chili's to the curing juices.

_Notes_
You can use any citrus to make a ceviche: lemon, lime, grape fruit, orange juice, whatever you fancy!
